# React Spring Demo

This is a demo showing a card deck that can be browsed through by dragging on a mouse or swiping with a finger on mobile devices. It utilizes [react-spring](https://github.com/react-spring/react-spring), a physics-based animation library for React. This means, that instead of defining a duration and easing function for animations, they are defined by velocity, direction etc., which in this demo are determined from the movement of the user's mouse or finger.

In this demo, the user can flick through the card deck, and when the user clicks/presses on one of the cards, it smoothly animates to fill (the upper part) of the screen. The route also changes, in order to enable direct links to each card.

The project is live [here](https://stupefied-lamarr-ef2102.netlify.com/).
